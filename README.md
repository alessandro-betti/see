This TeX/python repository hosts our vision project.
Since the project is quite ambitious we need to handle a bunch of different
files (mainly TeX files) in order to develop new parts of the theory.

The repository has two main subfolders:
1. TeX: Constains all TeX file with the theoretical analysis;
2. videomotion: Which contains the code. 

A seminal work (technical report) on the subject has already appeared
on the arxiv: [arXiv:1801.07110](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07110).

Stay tuned!
