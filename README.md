This TeX/python repository hosts my main PhD project about vision.
Since the project is quite ambitious I need to handle a bunch of different
files (mainly TeX files) in order to develop new parts of the theory

A seminal work (technical report) on the subject has already appeared
on the arxiv: [arXiv:1801.07110](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07110).

Stay tuned!
