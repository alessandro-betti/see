Another possible model for our theory is that of setting up an autoencoder.

This rises some questions:

     1. The number of hidden layers has to be chosen with some care since
        we imagine that we need an encoding and then a decoding phase;
     2. When working on multiple layer each layer needs to have an
     	"invariance under motion" term, also each set of weights must be
	properly regularized.
     3. We also might want to consider the idea of adding a mutual information
     	term for each layer, (why should this be helpful?? Duscuss this
	in some depth with Marco...)
     4. We need to have non linearity: This is very IMPORTANT since otherwise
     	everithing collapses to a single layer calculation. What kind of
	non-linearity we should use it is not yet clear (ReLu maybe?).

Write down the action and then try to do the variation!!!
