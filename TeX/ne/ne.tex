\noindent As it is pointed out in our technical report (arXiv:1801.07110)
the entropy term is not local in time. Here it is presented the third
possible solution that has been identified in the technical report.

In Appendix~B we derived that the action can be written as
$$ \eqalign{ {\cal A}(q)= &\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\Bigl(\int_0^Tdt\, h
\sum_{j\in J_i} b_j q_j\Bigr)^2+ \int_0^Tdt\, h
\Bigl(\frac{\alpha}{2}|\ddot q|^2+ \frac{\beta}{2}|\dot
q|^2+\frac{\lambda_M}{2}\dot q\cdot M^\natural \dot q\cr &+\lambda_M
q\cdot N^\natural \dot q+\frac{1}{2}q\cdot
\bigl(k-\lambda_CM^\natural+ \lambda_1 M+\lambda_M
O^\natural\bigr)q\cr &+\frac{1-\lambda_C}{n}b\cdot
q+w_s(t,q)\Bigr).\cr}\eqno(1)$$
The first term is non local in time; we can solve this problem by introducing
some auxiliary variables
$$s_i(t)=\sum_{x\in X^\sharp}\int_0^t d\tau\, \omega^t_x(\tau)
\feat^\sharp_{ix}(\tau),\eqno(2)$$
where $\omega^t_x(\tau)$
is some probability density over the retina and over the
temporal interval which has the property that $\sum_{x\in X^\sharp}\int_0^t
d\tau\, \omega_x^t(\tau)=1$. Of course one would be led to assume that
$\omega_x^t(\tau)=g_x h(\tau)/\int_0^td\tau\, h(\tau)$, however since we
are dealing with an approximation

Now replacing the entropy term with a causal term that is the temporal
mean of the entropy computed for each time $t$ on the interval $[0\dts t]$:
$$\frac{1}{T}\int_0^Tdt\, m(t) s_i^2(t).\eqno(3)$$
Moreover we also need to add to the action the constraint in Eq.~(2) in the
form
$$\int_0^T dt\, m(t)  \Bigl(\dot s_i- \sum_{x\in X^\sharp} \omega_x(t)
\feat^\sharp_{ix}(t)\Bigr)^2.$$
Here $m(t)$ is a smooth function of time; since it is not clear whether it
is better to weight the integral with $h(t)$ or not we will derive the EL
equations with this general function of time. Also we have set $\omega_x^t(t)
=\omega_x(t)$.

In this way Eq.~(1) becomes
$${\cal A}(q,s)=$$
